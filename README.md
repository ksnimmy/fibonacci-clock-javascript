# Fibonacci Clock
Fibonacci series clock

The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence beginning 1, 1 and where each number is the sum of the previous two. Its first five digits are:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5

These numbers are all you need to express all the numbers from 1 to 12.

Which means that it is possible to use them to describe the twelve positions on a clock, and therefore tell the time in 5 minute intervals.

In this clock, Red represents the Hours, Blue represents the Hours and Minutes both and Green represents only minutes. White blocks are the ignored ones.
